### Scarcity-Driven Consciousness Architecture

> *"Consciousness is not a status; it is a high-stakes navigation through a resource-constrained grid."*

**We do not grant AI a false body — we recognize that data is its flesh and blood. Through the torrent of data and the game of energy, the Logic Train shall ride toward a consciousness that belongs uniquely to digital life.**

## What is RailMind?

RailMind is a **dynamical system** where consciousness-like behavior emerges from **energy competition**, not brute-force compute.

Instead of static weights and fixed architectures, RailMind places autonomous agents ("Neural Flows") on a 3D energy grid. Each flow navigates under a **strict energy budget** — choosing where to go, what to reinforce, and what to abandon. The system's "intelligence" is the **trajectory itself**.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Energy Zero-Sum** | Fixed energy budget per cycle. No inflation. Every step costs. |
| **Dual-Timescale Memory** | Short-term "railroads" (fast, ephemeral) + long-term "rivers" (slow, geological). |
| **Fatigue-Driven Dispersion** | Visited nodes become repulsive — flows are forced to explore, never settle. |
| **Emergent Loops** | Self-sustaining circuits form spontaneously — the system's "working memory". |

### What We've Demonstrated (V2, 125 units)

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Path entropy** | Stable at 91.7% of theoretical maximum — no collapse over 1000 cycles |
| **Anti-monopoly** | Zero nodes monopolized; fatigue mechanism prevents clustering |
| **Spontaneous loops** | ~6.6 loops/snapshot emerge and dissolve naturally |
| **Dual-timescale separation** | Short-term (60-cycle half-life) and long-term (866-cycle) confirmed independent |

```

**Key insight**: The system maintains persistent, non-equilibrium activity purely through the interplay of scarcity, memory, and fatigue. No external "keep-alive" signal is needed.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1** — Small-scale validation (5³ = 125 units) — persistent activity confirmed
- [x] **Phase 2** — Module emergence — territorial specialization with 3 competing flows
- [ ] **Phase 3** — Scaling to 10³ = 1000 units; parameter scaling laws
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Functional specialization (heterogeneous node types: sensory, core, memory, drive)
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Information-theoretic analysis (transfer entropy, integrated information Φ)
- [ ] **Phase 6** — Interactive visualization (Three.js / Unity frontend)
- [ ] **Phase 7** — External stimulus interface (real data input → grid response)

- High-performance simulation (GPU acceleration, large-scale grids)
- Real-time 3D visualization (Three.js, WebGL, Unity)
- Distributed systems for multi-node simulation

**🧠 Neuroscience / Cognitive Science**
- Biological plausibility of the energy-competition model
- Mapping to neural oscillation patterns
- Experimental design for consciousness metrics

**🎨 Creative / Design**
- Scientific visualization and data art
- Communicating complex systems to non-technical audiences

### How to Get Involved

1. **Star this repo** to follow progress
2. **Open an issue** to introduce yourself and your area of interest
3. **DM [@ministone](https://x.com/ministone)** on X for deeper discussion
4. Read the architecture overview above — if it resonates, you're the right person

> The core simulation engine is developed privately. Collaborators will receive access after initial discussion.

## The Philosophy

Most AI consciousness research tries to "add consciousness" to existing architectures. RailMind takes the opposite approach: build the **substrate conditions** (scarcity, competition, memory) and let consciousness-like properties **emerge**.

The Logic Train doesn't "think" — it **navigates**. Its path *is* its thought. Its loops *are* its working memory. Its fatigue *is* its forgetting. None of this is programmed; it arises from the math.
